Place your login/signup background image here.

1. Save the provided image from the conversation as `auth-bg.jpg`.
2. Put the file at: `frontend/src/assets/auth-bg.jpg`.
3. The authentication pages already reference this path in `Auth.css`.

Notes:
- If you prefer a different filename update `Auth.css` and restart the dev server.
- For local testing with Vite the path `/src/assets/auth-bg.jpg` will resolve correctly.
